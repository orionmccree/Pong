#### Project Title: Pong

#### Date: Nov 26th, 2022

This program is built in Visual Studio with the Windows Forms framework. It features the classic game Pong and utilizes several
moving parts to make a Player Vs CPU score-based game where in order to win, either side must be the first to score a set
amount of points. The creation of this game involved heavy reliance on arrays, random variables, incremental changes in 
speed based on the X/Y axis, and machine logic to create the visual of a ball being hit between a player controlling a 
bar using the arrows keys and a CPU.

To run: Run the solution in Microsoft Visual Studio. This project requires the Windows Forms framework to run.
